# Generating Celebrities Faces Using DCGAN

This project aims to generate realistic facial images of celebrities. Leveraging the power of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), it seeks to learn the intricate patterns and features present in celebrity faces from a vast dataset.

## The idea behind Generative Adversarial Networks

A generator and a discriminator â€” trained simultaneously. The generator creates realistic data samples, like images, from random noise, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of these samples. Through adversarial training, the generator improves at creating realistic outputs, while the discriminator gets better at distinguishing real from fake samples.
